# A Singularity Container Recipe for Deep Learning

## Intended Purpose

This repository contains the recipe for a [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) container equipped with 
[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), 
[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/),
and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
With it, you can harness the power of GPUs on remote servers where you have limited permissions!

It came about because I wanted to do some deep learning tasks on GPU-equipped servers with inconsistent environments.

It took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to do this.
I had to dig through repositories, blog posts, and web forums.
I hope this repository helps other people figure things out faster than I did.
The script hasn't been tested across systems, etc., but it may be useful regardless.

## Usage

Follow these steps to build the Singularity image:

* Go to a host where you have root access (e.g., your personal computer). Clone this repository and `mv` into it.

* Make sure you have [Singularity installed](http://singularity.lbl.gov/docs-installation). If you're on a Mac, this may entail setting up a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machine.

* Download the following NVIDIA requirements and **move them to this directory**:

    - The CUDA toolkit ([version 9.0 tends to be a safe choice, as of this writing](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive)).
      The file suffix should be ".run".
    - The cuDNN library ([version 7.0 is compatible with CUDA 9.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)).
      The file suffix should be ".tgz".

* Set the variables in the `build_image.sh` script.

    - NVIDIA driver version. 384.111 may be a safe choice. It needs to be compatible with the CUDA installer, _and_ with the GPUs you'll be using. 
      These drivers will be installed via `apt-get` from within the container during construction.
    - CUDA version (get it from the name of the installer: `cuda_<version>_linux.run` )
    - cuDNN version (get it from the name of the installer: `cudnn-<version>.tgz` )

* Run the script as root: `sudo bash build_image.sh`. Then relax. It takes a little bit of time to build the image.

* `scp` the resulting image file to a host you want to work on---one that has Singularity installed, **and** has TensorFlow-capable GPUs.

* Test your image, e.g., by running `singularity exec --nv <your image> python3 keras_mnist_test.py`

If all goes well, you should see something like:

```
$ singularity exec --nv tf_keras.simg python3 keras_mnist_test.py
